        Catalys and solar cell technologies are under pinned by a fundamental process: that of exciting systems 
        to a higher energy level than the groundstate. Deninganeective methodt o achieve this that also provide 
        saccurate energies of the excited states is of ten a challenge. The EU-funded PTEROSOR project will tackle 
        this fundamental problem using mathematical techniques. The researchers 'novel approach forme asuring 
        the energies of excited states and dening wave functions in molecular systems will hinge on the use of
        a general class of Hamiltonians with parity-time(PT) symmetry. The gateway between ground and excited 
        states will be provided by...</a>
